# Gophersnake

Gophersnake is a stand-alone Gopher client for modern desktops, written in Python and TkInter. As of 2016-08-22, it's still at a very early stage (even searches don't work yet), but it's coming along.

## Wait, what's Gopher?

To oversimplify, Gopher was a precursor of the Web, that fell by the wayside for various reasons. Nowadays considered obsolete, it's kept alive by a handful of fans, not just out of nostalgia but also its genuine qualities.

Gopher is much simpler than the Web. It uses less bandwidth, processing power and screen space. It's still largely text-based, so you won't have to deal with annoying ads (or any kind of script for that matter). Gopher is limited, but what it can do, it does quickly, cleanly and with no fuss. And Gophersnake can help introduce you to this world.

## Install and run

Just download `gophersnake.py`, it's a self-contained script. To run it, you need Python and Tkinter. Both should be installed by default on Linux and Mac; for Windows, just download an official installer from www.python.org.

## Compatibility and bugs

Gophersnake is being developed on Python 3. For now it's still compatible with 2.7, but that could change at any time.

There's no error checking yet, and testing has been limited at best, but it seems to work for most directories and text files.
