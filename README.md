# Gophersnake

Gophersnake is a stand-alone Gopher client for modern desktops, written in Python and TkInter. As of 2016-08-21, it's still at a very early stage (even searches don't work yet), but it's coming along.

## Install and run

Just download `gophersnake.py`, it's a self-contained script. To run it, you need Python and Tkinter. Both should be installed by default on Linux and Mac; for Windows, just download an official installer from www.python.org.

## Compatibility and bugs

Gophersnake is being developed on Python 3. For now it's still compatible with 2.7, but that could change at any time.

There's no error checking yet, and testing has been limited at best, but it seems to work for most directories and text files.

## Roadmap

See the disabled buttons and menu options.
